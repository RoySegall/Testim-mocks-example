# Get joke example

1. Go to [Dad joke](https://rapidapi.com/KegenGuyll/api/dad-jokes/details) API and register for and get a key
2. Copy the `config.example.py` to `config.py` and the set the key you got
3. Create a local env (my Python is a bit rusty on this one)
4. You can run `py sandbox` to get a dad joke.
